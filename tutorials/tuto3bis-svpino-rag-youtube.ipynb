      "I think it's possible that physics has exploits and we should be trying to find them. arranging some kind of a crazy quantum mechanical system that somehow gives you buffer overflow, somehow gives you a rounding error in the floating point. Synthetic intelligences are kind of like the next stage of development. And I don't know where it leads to. Like at some point, I suspect the universe is some kind of a puzzle. These synthetic AIs will uncover that puzzle and solve it. The following is a conversation with Andre Kappathi, previously the director of AI at Tesla. And before that, at OpenAI and Stanford, he is one of the greatest scientist engineers and educators in the history of artificial intelligence. This is the Lex Friedman podcast to support it. Please check out our sponsors and now to your friends. Here's Andre Kappathi. What is a neural network? And what does it seem to do such a surprisingly good job of learning? What is a neural network? It's a mathematical abstraction of the\n",
      "############################################# CHUNK 2 ##############################################\n",
      "abstraction of the brain. I would say that's how it was originally developed. At the end of the day, it's a mathematical expression. And it's a fairly simple mathematical expression when you get down to it. It's basically a sequence of meter smoke applies, whichever link dot products mathematically. And some non-linearities throw them in. And so it's a very simple mathematical expression. And it's got knobs in it. Many knobs. Many knobs. And these knobs are loosely related to basically the synapses in your brain. They're trainable, they're modifiable. And so the idea is we need to find the setting of the knobs that makes the neural net do whatever you want it to do, like classify images and so on. And so there's not too much mystery I would say in it. Like you might think that basically don't want to end out with too much meaning with respect to the brain and how it works. It's really just a complicated mathematical expression with knobs. And those knobs need a proper setting for it\n",
      "############################################# CHUNK 3 ##############################################\n",
      "a proper setting for it to do something desirable. Yeah, but poetry is just the collection of letters with spaces. But it can make us feel a certain way. And in that same way, when you get a large number of knobs together, whether it's inside the brain or inside a computer, they seem to they seem to surprise us with their power. Yeah, I think that's fair. So basically I'm underselling it by a lot because you definitely do get very surprising emergent behaviors out of these neural nets when they're large enough and trained on complicated enough problems. Like say, for example, the next word prediction in a massive data set from the internet. And then these neural nets take on pretty surprising magical properties. Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting how much you can get out of even very simple mathematical formalism. When your brain right now is talking, is it doing next word prediction? Or is it doing something more interesting? Well, it's definitely some kind of a generative model\n"

So Hollywood will start using it to generate scenes, which completely opens up. Yeah, so you can make a movie like Avatar eventually for under a million dollars. Much less.
